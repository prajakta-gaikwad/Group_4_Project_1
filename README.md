# How Can Airbnb Hosts Improve their Profitability and Ratings ?
## Strategy and Metrics:
Airbnb Hosts:
* All property owners in the US who have listed their properties on Airbnb.
* Everyone in the US who is intending to invest in Airbnb properties.
Profitability:
* Airbnb earnings based on the number of reviews on a listing and their nightly price.
Ratings:
* Number of Reviews on Airbnb
* Average aggregated ratings on the 0-100 scale (ratings can be divided by 20 to get star ratings on a 0-5 scale)

In this project, we have organized and analyzed a database of around **74,000 listings** in **6 cities in the US**; in an attempt to discover any trends on how **Host Profits** and **User Ratings** vary across **Locations, Property Types and Amenities.**
